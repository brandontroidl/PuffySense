# PuffySense

## Overview

PuffySense is a free, open-source network firewall and router platform built on top of the OpenBSD operating system. Designed with security, simplicity, and correctness in mind, PuffySense uses OpenBSDs robust foundation along with a clean interface and modular tools to deliver a powerful alternative to commercial firewall appliances.

Thanks to OpenBSDs secure-by-default design, packet filter (PF), and a curated selection of additional open tools, PuffySense offers advanced networking features without vendor lock-in, license fees, or hidden limitations.

Configuration and management are handled entirely through a streamlined web interface no shell access or manual configuration is required. While those unfamiliar with firewall concepts may face a slight learning curve, administrators accustomed to commercial products will quickly feel at home.

PuffySense began as a modern rethinking of traditional firewall platforms, with an emphasis on clarity, code quality, and secure defaults. Built from the ground up on OpenBSD not forked from legacy systems architecture reflects the OpenBSD philosophy of minimalism, auditability, and correctness.

PuffySense is free software, maintained by a community committed to open infrastructure. Learn more at https://puffysense.net and support development by contributing code, documentation, or acquiring supported hardware.
